# 2.2.0
This release is focused on improving the retry logic, optimizing it and handling more possible failures, as well as more 
strictly defining the API to help prevent misuse. These changes are potentially breaking if the driver is being used in 
a way that isn't supported by the documentation.

## :tada: Enhancements
* Improved retry logic
   * Failures when starting a new session are now retried.
   * Dead sessions are immediately discarded, reducing latency when using the driver.
   * `ClientError`, `DriverClosedError`, `LambdaAbortedError`, and `SessionPoolEmptyError` are now exported.
   * Peer dependency `aws-sdk` bumped to `2.841.0` or greater, which gives visibility to `CapacityExceededException`.
 * Updated the exponential backoff algorithm to better align with the algorithm specified [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/).
 * Specify minimum Node.js version to 10.0 in [package.json](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs/blob/master/package.json#L13).

## :warning: API Clean-up 

These changes either remove unintentionally exported modules or remove the use of `any`. Updating to 2.2.0 should not break any documented usage of the driver and should not require code changes. If something is now incompatible and it's believed that it should be, please open an issue.

* TypeScript: updated `executeLambda` signature

  * ```typescript
    // Old
    async ExecuteLambda(transactionLambda: (transactionExecutor: TransactionExecutor) => any, 
        retryConfig?: RetryConfig): Promise<any>;
    // New
    async ExecuteLambda<Type>(transactionLambda: (transactionExecutor: TransactionExecutor) => Promise<Type>,
        retryConfig?: RetryConfig): Promise<Type>;
    ```

  * The returned value from the `transactionLambda` is what `ExecuteLambda` returns, so it's now strictly defined by the `Type`.

  * The `transactionLambda` must return a `Promise`, as any methods called on the `TransactionExecutor` must be awaited for the driver to properly function.

* JavaScript: removed `QldbDriver.getSession()`

  * This is unavailable to TypeScript users and was not intended to be called directly by JavaScript users.

* Module exports

  * Removed `Transaction` from the exports list.
  * Removed modules being accessible when importing from `amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs/src`.
  * TypeScript: Removed constructors in the API for some exported types.

## :bug: Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where `No open transaction` or `Transaction already open` errors would occur

# 2.1.1
* Export `ResultReadable`.
* Change the return type of `executeAndStreamResults()` from `Readable` to `ResultReadable` which extends `Readable`.
* `getConsumedIOs(): IOUsage` and `getTimingInformation(): TimingInformation` functions, are accessible through `ResultReadable`.

# 2.1.0
Add support for obtaining basic server-side statistics on individual statement executions.

## :tada: Enhancements
* Added `IOUsage` and `TimingInformation` interface to provide server-side execution statistics
   * IOUsage provides `getReadIOs(): number`
   * TimingInformation provides `getProcessingTimeMilliseconds(): number`
   * Added `getConsumedIOs(): IOUsage` and `getTimingInformation(): TimingInformation` to the `Result` and `ResultStream`
   * `getConsumedIOs(): IOUsage` and `getTimingInformation(): TimingInformation` methods are stateful, meaning the statistics returned by them reflect the state at the time of method execution

#### Note: For using version 2.1.0 and above of the driver, the version of the aws-sdk should be >= 2.815
