# Amazon QLDB Node.js Driver

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-v2.1.1-green)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs)  [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-api-green.svg)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.nodejs.html)

This is the Node.js driver for Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB), which allows Node.js developers to write software that makes use of AmazonQLDB.

## Requirements

### Basic Configuration

See [Accessing Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/accessing.html) for information on connecting to AWS.

The JavaScript AWS SDK needs to have AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG environment variable set to a truthy value in order to read
from the ~/.aws/config file.

See [Setting Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-region.html) page for more information.

### TypeScript 3.5.x

The driver is written in, and requires, TypeScript 3.5.x. It will be automatically installed as a dependency. 
Please see the link below for more detail on TypeScript 3.5.x:

* [TypeScript 3.5.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)



## Getting Started

To use the driver, in your package that wishes to use the driver, run the following:

```npm install amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs```

The driver also has aws-sdk, ion-js and jsbi as peer dependencies. Thus, they must also be dependencies of the package that will be using the driver as a dependency.

```npm install aws-sdk```

```npm install ion-js```

```npm install jsbi```

#### Note: For using version 2.1.0 and above of the driver, the version of the aws-sdk should be >= 2.815

Then from within your package, you can now use the driver by importing it. This example shows usage in TypeScript specifying the QLDB ledger name and a specific region:

```javascript
import { QldbDriver } from "amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs";

const testServiceConfigOptions = {
    region: "us-east-1"
};

const qldbDriver: QldbDriver = new QldbDriver("testLedger", testServiceConfigOptions);
qldbDriver.getTableNames().then(function(tableNames: string[]) {
    console.log(tableNames);
});
```

5. Amazon QLDB supports the [PartiQL](https://partiql.org/) query language. PartiQL provides SQL-compatible query access across multiple data stores containing structured data, semistructured data, and nested data. For more information read the [PartiQL docs](https://partiql.org/docs.html).
6. Refer the section [Common Errors while using the Amazon QLDB Drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/driver-errors.html) which describes runtime errors that can be thrown by the Amazon QLDB Driver when calling the qldb-session APIs.


## Development

### Setup

To install the dependencies for the driver, run the following in the root directory of the project:

```npm install```

To build the driver, transpiling the TypeScript source code to JavaScript, run the following in the root directory:

```npm run build```

### Running Tests

You can run the unit tests with this command:

```npm test```

or

```npm run testWithCoverage```

### Integration Tests

You can run the integration tests with this command:

```npm run integrationTest```

This command requires that credentials are pre-configured and it has the required permissions.

Additionally, a region can be specified in: `src/integrationtest/.mocharc.json`.
