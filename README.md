This is the Node.js driver for [Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/), which allows Node.js developers to write software that makes use of Amazon QLDB.

For getting started with the driver, see [Node.js and Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started.nodejs.html).

## Requirements

### Basic Configuration

See [Accessing Amazon QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/accessing.html) for information on connecting to AWS.

The JavaScript AWS SDK needs to have `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG` environment variable set to a truthy value in order to read
from the `~/.aws/config` file.

See [Setting Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-region.html) page for more information.

### TypeScript 3.8.x

Development of the driver requires TypeScript 3.8.x. It will be automatically installed as a dependency. It is also recommended to use TypeScript when using the driver.
Please see the link below for more detail on TypeScript 3.8.x:

* [TypeScript 3.8.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)


## Getting Started

Please see the [Quickstart guide for the Amazon QLDB Driver for Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/driver-quickstart-nodejs.html).

To use the driver, in your package that wishes to use the driver, run the following:

```npm install amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs```

The driver also has @aws-sdk/client-qldb-session, ion-js and jsbi as peer dependencies. Thus, they must also be dependencies of the package that will be using the driver as a dependency.

```npm install @aws-sdk/client-qldb-session```

```npm install ion-js```

```npm install jsbi```

#### Note: For using version 3.0.0 and above of the driver, the version of the aws-sdk should be >= 3.x

Then from within your package, you can now use the driver by importing it. This example shows usage in TypeScript specifying the QLDB ledger name and a specific region:

```typescript
import { QLDBSessionClientConfig } from "@aws-sdk/client-qldb-session";
import { QldbDriver } from "amazon-qldb-driver-nodejs";

const testServiceConfigOption: QLDBSessionClientConfig = {
    region: "us-east-1"
};

const qldbDriver: QldbDriver = new QldbDriver("testLedger", testServiceConfigOptions);
qldbDriver.getTableNames().then(function(tableNames: string[]) {
    console.log(tableNames);
});
```

## Development

### Setup

To install the dependencies for the driver, run the following in the root directory of the project:

```npm install```

To build the driver, transpiling the TypeScript source code to JavaScript, run the following in the root directory:

```npm run build```

### Running Tests

You can run the unit tests with this command:

```npm test```

or

```npm run testWithCoverage```

### Integration Tests

You can run the integration tests with this command:

```npm run integrationTest```

This command requires that credentials are pre-configured and it has the required permissions.

Additionally, a region can be specified in: `src/integrationtest/.mocharc.json`.

### Documentation 

TypeDoc is used for documentation. You can generate HTML locally with the following:

```npm run doc```
