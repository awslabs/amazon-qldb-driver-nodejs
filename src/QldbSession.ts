/**
 * The top-level interface for a QldbSession object for interacting with QLDB. A QldbSession is linked to the specified 
 * ledger in the parent driver of the instance of the QldbSession. In any given QldbSession, only one transaction can be 
 * active at a time. This object can have only one underlying session to QLDB, and therefore the lifespan of a 
 * QldbSession is tied to the underlying session, which is not indefinite, and on expiry this QldbSession will become 
 * invalid, and a new QldbSession needs to be created from the parent driver in order to continue usage.
 *
 * When a QldbSession is no longer needed, {@linkcode QldbSession.close} should be invoked in order to clean up any 
 * resources.
 *
 * See {@linkcode PooledQldbDriver} for an example of session lifecycle management, allowing the re-use of sessions 
 * when possible.
 *
 * There are three methods of execution, ranging from simple to complex; the first two are recommended for inbuilt 
 * error handling:
 *  - {@linkcode QldbSession.executeStatement} allows for a single statement to be executed within a transaction where 
 *    the transaction is implicitly created and committed, and any recoverable errors are transparently handled.
 *  - {@linkcode QldbSession.executeLambda} allow for more complex execution sequences where more than one execution can 
 *    occur, as well as other method calls. The transaction is implicitly created and committed, and any recoverable 
 *    errors are transparently handled.
 *  - {@linkcode QldbSession.startTransaction} allows for full control over when the transaction is committed and 
 *    leaves the responsibility of OCC conflict handling up to the user. Transactions' methods cannot be automatically 
 *    retried, as the state of the transaction is ambiguous in the case of an unexpected error.
